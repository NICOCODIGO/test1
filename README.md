# First Personal Project (HTML & CSS)

<h1>The Pan Bakery (Portfolio project)</h1>
The website I created represents a fictional bakery place if I was to run it one day which served as my first personal project for myself to show off.
But my main objective was to improve my HTML and CSS abilities with the knowlegde I learned in my classes and put them to work and to continue educating myself.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏èThe Current Status</h2>
<li>Projects uses only HTML and CSS</li>
<li>CSS needed a LOT of work on the debuggung, reworking classes & division, so its messy and clustred but I will keep improving on making css easy to read for me to explain</li>
<li>In the future I will work on more javascript and make my codes or organize, scale, and readable</li>
